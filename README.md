# The Lounge UI
This repository contains the code for The Lounge, which is currently under development.


# Environment Setup

We're using the latest version of Angular 1, along with Material 2 and several other Node packages. You'll need to install the latest versions of Gulp, Node, NPM, and browserify.

# Run the Application

Once the environment is set up, you should be able to run it from a terminal, at the root of the project with `gulp`.
